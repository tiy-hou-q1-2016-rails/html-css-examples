          <p>You wanna be where you can see our troubles are all the same. You wanna be where everybody knows Your name. A man is born he's a man of means. Then along come two they got nothin' but their jeans. I have always wanted to have a neighbor just like you. I've always wanted to live in a neighborhood with you.

    These Happy Days are yours and mine Happy Days. Now were up in the big leagues getting' our turn at bat. Makin' your way in the world today takes everything you've got. Takin' a break from all your worries sure would help a lot! Thank you for being a friend. Travelled down the road and back again. Your heart is true you're a pal and a confidant. Texas tea. So get a witch's shawl on a broomstick you can crawl on. Were gonna pay a call on the Addams Family. Here he comes Here comes Speed Racer. He's a demon on wheels. The ship set ground on the shore of this uncharted desert isle with Gilligan the Skipper too the millionaire and his wife. Why do we always come here? I guess well never know. Its like a kind of torture to have to watch the show! Their house is a museum where people come to see ‘em. They really are a scream the Addams Family. The movie star the professor and Mary Ann here on Gilligans Isle.

    These days are all Happy and Free. These days are all share them with me oh baby. Come and knock on our door. We've been waiting for you. Where the kisses are hers and hers and his. Three's company too. Just two good ol' boys Never meanin' no harm. Beats all you've ever saw been in trouble with the law since the day they was born? The weather started getting rough - the tiny ship was tossed. If not for the courage of the fearless crew the Minnow would be lost. the Minnow would be lost. They call him Flipper Flipper faster than lightning. No one you see is smarter than he. Goodbye gray sky hello blue. There's nothing can hold me when I hold you. Feels so right it cant be wrong. Rockin' and rollin' all week long. Wouldn't you like to get away? Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name. And they're always glad you came. So lets make the most of this beautiful day. Since we're together That this group would somehow form a family that's the way we all became the Brady Bunch. Their house is a museum where people come to see ‘em. They really are a scream the Addams Family.
